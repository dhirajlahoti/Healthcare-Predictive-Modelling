# Diabetes and BMI Prediction

The project aims to find out which risk factors are most predictive of diabetes and how these factors relate to the risk of developing diabetes. The project also models the relationship between diabetes and BMI. 

Q1 and Q3

## Installation

User will need Python and jupyter notebooks to run the code.
```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
Download the dataset and run the code for Q1 and Q3. They are titled ‘LinearRegression’, ‘Decision-tree-ensemble-methods’ respectively. 

```
## Usage
Run all the cells in the Jupyter notebook. It should return the relevant accuracy results and plots for each of the questions. 

Q2

User will need R-Studio.
Install nnet package.
Download the dataset and run the R code for Q2. These are the code files titled- ‘Naïve-Bayes-Rcode’ and ‘Logistic-Regression-Rcode’.
It should give the values for coefficients, p-values and log odds ratio.
